i think we messed the'liveable experience' card because it has been pushed completely out of the visible part of the page. just return it to where it was before. now, we need to create the product-detail component that will show more details about a product and will have buy now button, add to cart, quantity counter and any other thing necessary for such, so that when a product is clicked on the gift shop, its details page opens. then, newsletter-detail should show the newsletter just like a magazine - with a cover page and contents such that when reader uses it the experience is such that he/she flips like a book from page to page.
